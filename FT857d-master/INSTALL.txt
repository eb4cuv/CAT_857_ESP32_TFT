Simply put the "FT857d" folder in your Arduino "libraries" folder.

Actually there is a bug hidden in some place that don't allow the example to get showed properly on the "Examples" menu of the Arduino IDE.

But that does not make it bad, just install the lib and copy the example to your sketch folder and run it.

Sorry for the inconvenience, Pavel.
